# Getting Started in Revit

## Getting Started Checklist

Here is a short checklist, before getting started with the Pollination Revit plugin:

1. If you haven't already installed the Revit plugin you need to [download](../get-started/setting-up-rhino-grasshopper-and-revit-plugins/download-plugins.md) and [install the plugin](../get-started/setting-up-rhino-grasshopper-and-revit-plugins/download-and-install-plugins.md) on your computer.
2. You need to [purchase a license](../get-started/account-setup/purchase-and-manage-plugins.md) if you have already used the 14-day trial period.
3. If you will be using a license from a Pollination organization, ensure you have been added to the correct license pool. See [this page](../get-started/manage-license-pool.md) for more information.

## Navigating the Tab

Once Revit opens, you can find a tab for Pollination in the ribbon. The Pollination tab has 4 sections, Plugin, Resources, Model, and Simulation.
