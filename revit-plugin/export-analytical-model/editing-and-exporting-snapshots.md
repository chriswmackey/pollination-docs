# Editing and Exporting Snapshots

Once you have the snapshots you are almost done, you can now use the [Pollination Model Editor](broken-reference) to clean up the snapshots quickly and export them to any of the [supported file formats](../../model-editor/supported-file-formats/export.md).

To open the Model Editor click on the `Edit & Export Model` button.
