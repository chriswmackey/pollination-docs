# Creating Snapshots

The first step of the process is to translate the Revit model to Pollination Model Snapshots, also known as Snapshots for abbreviation. Snapshots are lightweight analytical representations of the model that are easy to visualize, edit, and export without the need to edit the Revit model itself.

This video tutorial shows you how to create the snapshots for the Revit advanced sample model.

**Introduction**

* [0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=0s) Introduction

**Selecting windows and doors**

* [1:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=70s) How to select apertures and doors
* [1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=110s) How to visualize the apertures and doors in the Revit model
* [2:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=147s) How to filter the apertures and doors for each level

**Exporting rooms**

* [3:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=207s) General settings for exporting rooms
* [5:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=307s) Review level settings step

**Exporting the entry-level**

* [6:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=390s) Review ground level for missing rooms
* [7:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=446s) Different options for placing missing rooms
* [9:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=545s) The option for excluding apertures and doors
* [9:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=599s) Preview the ground level Pollination rooms
* [10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=625s) The differences between the preview options
* [11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=676s) Change the height for double-height rooms
* [13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=820s) Assign room thermal properties (optional)
* [14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=895s) Save ground-level rooms as a Pollination model snapshot

**Two options for simplifying the model**

* [16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=991s) Use Revit areas or spaces to decrease the number of rooms
* [18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1116s) Detailed windows versus calculating windows based on the window-to-wall ratio

**Exporting the second-level**

* [20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1206s) Export the second level as a Pollination model snapshot

**Snapshot SDK incompatibility warning**

* [22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1345s) Snapshot SDK incompatibility warning

**Exporting the third-level**

* [23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1385s) Export the third level as a Pollination model snapshot
* [25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1534s) Validation routine and invalid skylights
* [26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1599s) Plans for linking snapshots back to the Model Editor

**Exporting shades**

* [27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1650s) Export shades as a Pollination model snapshot
* [29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUzhOOmaU2M\&t=1780s) Include shades in the same snapshot with the rooms

Once you have the snapshots you can start editing them and merging them before exporting them to any of the [supported file formats](../../model-editor/supported-file-formats/export.md). The next page covers the steps for cleaning up the snapshots.
