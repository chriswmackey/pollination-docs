# Exporting Energy Models from Revit

We have an anti-hype approach for exporting valid analytical models from Revit. We neither simplify the problem nor pretend we have found the magic bullet. Instead, we have developed a practical product that helps you get a valid model from the real-world imperfect Revit models.

### The 3 facts about Revit models for energy modelers

Before we start the process, here are the 3 facts about Revit models for energy modelers:

1. You will never ever ever receive a Revit model from an Architect ready to be exported as an energy model. Just get over it!
2. Revit models are prepared for a different purpose than energy modeling. Mostly, documentation. This will not change because you don't like it.
3. Even though Revit models are imperfect and messy, they are full of useful information. That's why the last model that you built was traced over a PDF generated from Revit!

That means every export process requires a minimum amount of work. To speed up this process, we have developed to help you save a significant amount of time with a minimum but necessary user interaction.
