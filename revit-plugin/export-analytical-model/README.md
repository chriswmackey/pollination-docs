# Exporting Energy Models from Revit

This section covers the process for exporting your Revit models as an energy model to any of the supported energy modeling software, including but not limited to IES VE, EnergyPlus, OpenStudio, eQuest, and IDA ICE.

## Is Pollination the right tool for you?

Before getting started, we need to set some ground rules. Pollination Revit plugin is a practical solution for exporting Revit models based on our learning from exporting several hundred real-world Revit models. We're committed to helping you export your models from Revit as long as you have realistic expectations.

Let's start with the 3 facts about using Revit models for energy modeling:

1. **Revit architecture models always need some cleanup before being exported as energy models**. We know you might have heard otherwise. That's far from what we have seen in the real world. Just get over it!
2. **Revit models are prepared for documentation, not simulation**. This is not going to change because you don't like it.
3. **Revit models are imperfect but contain valuable data for energy models**. Ignore this fact at your peril. That's why the last model you built was traced over a PDF generated from Revit!

We neither simplify the problem nor pretend we have found the magic bullet. Instead, we have developed a practical product that helps you get a valid model from the real-world imperfect Revit models.

That means every export process requires a minimum amount of work to get the valuable information out of Revit. Pollination helps you with visualizing, editing, and validating this information. Once you have the valid Pollination model, [we guarantee an accurate export to all of the supported simulation software](https://www.pollination.solutions/pact).

If this sounds good to you, then we have a great solution for you; otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else!
