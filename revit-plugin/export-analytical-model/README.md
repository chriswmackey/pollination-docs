# Exporting Energy Models from Revit

We have an anti-hype approach for exporting valid analytical models from Revit. We neither simplify the problem nor pretend we have found the magic bullet. Instead, we have developed a practical product that helps you get a valid model from the real-world imperfect Revit models.

### The 3 facts about Revit models for energy modelers

Before we start the process, here are the 3 facts about Revit models for energy modelers:

1. Revit architecture models always need some cleanup before being exported as energy models. Just get over it!
2. Revit models are prepared for documentation, not simulation. This is not going to change because you don't like it.
3. Revit models are imperfect but contain useful data for energy models. Ignore this fact at your own peril. That's why the last model you built was traced over a PDF generated from Revit!

That means every export process requires a minimum amount of work. To speed up this process, we have developed to help you save a significant amount of time with a minimum but necessary user interaction.
