Last but not least, we will convert the roof extensions on top of the entrance into shades. To do so, you need to create a boundary around the rooms and use the boundary to split the roof. Then you can select the roof and convert it to a shade using the [Roof to Shades](../../../model-editor/commands/me_roof_to_shade.md) command.
