After finding and fixing all the visible issues, it is time to inspect the model for invisible issues that we might have missed. The Model Editor provides a collection of commands and utilities to help with this process:

* ![](../../../model-editor/commands/images/find-adjacency-gaps.svg)[Find Adjacency Gaps](../../../model-editor/commands/me_find_adjacency_gaps.md)
* Highlight Non-orthogonal Walls (Alt + O)
* ![](../../../model-editor/commands/images/solve-adjacency.svg) [Solve Adjacency](../../../model-editor/commands/me_solve_adjacency.md)
* Highlight External Walls (Alt + E)
