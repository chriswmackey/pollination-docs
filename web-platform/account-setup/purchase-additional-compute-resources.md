# 6. Add Additional Computing Resources

An organization includes an unlimited number of projects, recipes, and teams but it doesn't include any computing resources by default. To run simulations under an organization account, you need to buy additional computing resources for your organization.

{% hint style="info" %}
The computing resources will be shared among all the organization's projects and members.
{% endhint %}

Pollination provides several options based on your needs. You can either select a monthly or an annual billing period.

{% hint style="info" %}
The annual billing offers a free month of subscription.

5.  Change the `Quantity` of the package if needed. Keep in mind that the quantity will be multiplied by the amount of resources that are available in the package. Keep in mind that the number of parallel CPUs is capped at 1200 CPUs for each organization.

    If you have a discount code you may use it at this step and before finishing the purchase by clicking on the `+ Add discount` button.
7. Congrats! Cloud computing resources are now added to your organization. Now you can use them to run your studies on the cloud.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We use Paddle for processing the payments. As a result, it might take a few seconds before the subscription shows up under your account. If you don't see the subscription under your account immediately try to refresh the page and the card should be updated.
