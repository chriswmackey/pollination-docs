# 3. Add Team Members



{% hint style="warning" %}
You can only add additional members to your organization after purchasing additional seats. See [this page](purchase-additional-seats.md) for more information about purchasing additional seats.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Only owners of an organization can add new members and manage permissions. Once you add members to your organization, you still need to add members to projects or CAD license pools to give them access to the resources.
{% endhint %}

Here is the step-by-step process to add a Pollination account to your organization.

![How to add a member to your organization](../../.gitbook/assets/add\_team\_members.gif)

1. Go to the Members' tab under the organization page.
2. Click on the <mark style="background-color:blue;">Add Member</mark> button.
3. Use the search for members field to search for eligible members with Pollination accounts.
4. Select the role for the new member. A member can be an Owner or a Member of the organization.
5. Click on the <mark style="background-color:blue;">Add Member</mark> again to add them to the organization.
6. Congrats! The member has been added to your organization. They can now access organization resources including computing resources and CAD licenses.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the new member is added as a member, not an owner, of the organization they will NOT have access to the Rhino or Revit licenses by default. You must give them access to the CAD licenses by [adding them to the license pool](../../get-started/manage-license-pool.md).

This allows you to add several members to the organization and limit the number of users who can use the organization's CAD plugin licenses.

{% hint style="info" %}
A free Starter account is required for a member to be added to an organization.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
An organization must at least have one owner. We recommend assigning an additional owner to help you with managing the organization. A good practice is to keep everyone else as a member unless they must be an owner to manage the organization's resources.
