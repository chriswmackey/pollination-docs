# 2. Buy Organization Seats

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to skip this step if you are the only user of the organization. Each organization comes with a single free seat.

[Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bb92mEcq4pw) to better understand how Pollination licensing and pricing work. It also covers the difference between organization seats and Rhino and Revit licenses.

You need to add additional seats to your organization account before adding new members to the organization. Pollination provides several options based on the size of your team. You can either select a monthly or an annual billing period.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The annual billing offers a free month of subscription.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not possible to mix the plans. For instance, you cannot buy 5 individual seats and one 10-seat package together. However, you can purchase multiple quantities of the same package.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The quantity will be multiplied by the number of seats available in each package. For example, if you purchase three 10-seat subscriptions, you will have 3 \* 10 = 30 seats.
{% endhint %}

Here are the steps to purchase the seats for your organization:

1.  Click on the profile picture on the top right of the page, and switch to the organization account.\

    If you have a discount code, you may use it at this step and before finishing the purchase by clicking on the `+ Add discount` button.\

7. Congrats! The seats have now been added to your organization. The next step is to add new members to your organization.

{% hint style="warning" %}
We use Paddle for processing the payments. As a result, it might take a few seconds before the subscription shows up under your account. If you don't see the subscription under your account immediately, try to refresh the page, and the card should be updated.
