# Manage Subscriptions

Once you buy a Pollination product, you can manage the subscription from the card. Each card has several tabs.

### **Subscription**

Under the _Subscription_ tab, you can see the information about your current subscription. You can also update or cancel your subscription from this tab.

You can cancel your subscription at any point in time, but we will not be able to provide prorated refunds for your cancellation. We suggest starting with monthly subscriptions and only switching to an annual subscription when you're confident about your purchase for a year.

### PayPal/Card

The name of this tab will be different based on your method of payment. In both cases, you can use this tab to update your payment method.

### **Payments**

Under the _Payments_ tab, you can access both upcoming payments and past payments with links to download a copy of your payment receipt.
