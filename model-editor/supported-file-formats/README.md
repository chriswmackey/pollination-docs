# Supported File Formats

Pollination's wide array of supported file formats makes it the interoperability tool of choice for building performance simulation. Most tools lock you into one or two proprietary formats, but Pollination is set to change this once and for all. When you have a valid model in any Pollination interface, including the Model Editor, you can export it to your favorite building performance simulation software including but not limited to IES VE, eQuest, OpenStudio, EnergyPlus, Ladybug Tools Honeybee, and IDA ICE.

You can also import several different file formats to the Model Editor for review and cleanup before exporting them to your building performance simulation.

## Model Editor native file format

The Model Editor's native file format is PoMF. It stands for **Po**llination **M**odel **F**ormat, and it includes the model geometry and metadata information as well as the alignment lines and any text of annotations that has been added to the model.
