# FAQ

## Does the data leave my local machine when I use the Model Editor from inside Revit?

No. When you use the Model Editor from inside Revit all the data stays on your local machine. Model Editor uses the [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) technology to embed the Model Editor into the Pollination Revit plugin. The data are either stored in the browser's local cache or on your local hard drive.



## Why do I see the "The Model Editor is built against a newer version of the Revit plugin." warning message when I open the Model Editor?

Because you are using an older version of the Revit plugin. Upgrade and it will be fixed.

## What are the differences between the online version of the Model Editor, and the embedded version of the Model Editor in Revit?

They are the same technology with different scopes, and they run differently.
