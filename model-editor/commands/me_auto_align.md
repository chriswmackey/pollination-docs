# Auto align

Automatically align selected rooms to common axes identified across them. The command is intended to automatically perform most of the alignments that would typically be done manually. Note that having a line selected while running this command will force the generated alignment axes to be generated only in the plane of that line.

## Options

* **Distance**

  The distance with which room vertices will be aligned to common axes. No vertex in the input rooms will be moved more than this distance

* **Exclude Angle**

  A positive number in degrees for the maximum difference that a geometry segment can differ from the alignment axes for it to be ignored/excluded from alignment

* **Story-by-Story**

  Select to have this command run with each story individually rather than all stories of the model together. Running story-by-story tends to produce a more controlled and result with fewer unintended alignments happening. This is useful when the model is large and rooms between stories do not have a strong relation to one another.

* **Axes Only**

  Select to have this command only output the common axes of the selected rooms into the scene and not perform any auto-alignment of rooms with these axes. This can give more control over which axes are or are not used by allowing manual selection and aligning with desired axes
