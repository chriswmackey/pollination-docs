# Validate model
<img src="images/validate-model.svg" width="50" height="50"> 

Check whether the selected rooms are valid/simulate-able. Valid models should export to any of the supported BEM engines without errors. Invalid models will have their errors presented in a table with the option to select the part of the model where the error originates so that it can be fixed.

## Options

* **Destination Engine**

  The destination engine for which validation will be performed. Selecting an option here will ignore checks that are not relevant for the engine. Use the 'Generic' option if the intention is to make a model for multiple engines.
