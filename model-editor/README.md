# MODEL EDITOR

You can access the Snapshot online at https://editor.pollination.cloud. The snapshot comes with a sample model that you can use to test the model editor functionalities or create a snapshot from your model using the Rhino or Revit plugins.

## How to create a snapshot

### Rhino

In Rhino you can create a snapshot by using the `PO_TakeSnapshot` command. Use the `PO_SnapshotManager` command to edit the snapshot information, and open the snapshot in the editor.

### Revit

In Revit, press the `Export Model` button and follow the steps for exporting the model. Click on the Snapshot button to create a snapshot from the selected rooms.
