# What is Pollination Model Editor

Model Editor is the outcome of cleaning up hundreds of Revit models. It helps you automatically fix all the common issues in energy model geometries. See the link below to try the Model Editor with Revit sample models.

## Model Editor UI

The screenshot below shows the different sections of the model editor. When the model editor is accessed from inside the Revit plugin you will see a `Snapshots` button in the bottom left corner. Click on the button to open the snapshot manager that shows all the available snapshots.
