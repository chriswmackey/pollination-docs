## Room Commands

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/align.svg) Align

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Snap Vertices

A boolean to snap the room vertices to the alignment line vertices after aligning the vertex to the closest point on the alignment line.

#### Align Distance

The maximum distance in the document units between the room vertex and the alignment line in which the room should be aligned to the line.

</details>

Align the selected rooms' vertices to the selected lines/polylines if the room vertices lie within the specified `Alignment Distance`. Using the `Snap Vertices` option will perform an additional operation that tries to snap the vertices to line/polyline vertices after running the alignment.

This command is primarily useful for fixing the misalignments between rooms, which are common in the raw export of Revit rooms. It is also useful for adjusting the exterior boundary around entire stories, enabling you to align rooms to the inside or outside wall finish instead of using the wall centerline as is typical when exporting Revit rooms. See the Create Boundary command for more information.

This command is only visible when at least one room and one alignment line/polyline are selected.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/pull-to-room.svg) Pull to room

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Coordinate Vertices

A boolean to coordinate the vertices from the pull rooms with the target rooms' vertices after the initial pull.

#### Pull Distance

The maximum distance in the document units between the room vertex and the room edges in which the room should be pulled to the other room.

</details>

Pull the vertices of one or more rooms to the first "target" room in the selection. The operation of pulling can be thought of as aligning the rooms to the target room's segments and then snapping to its vertices. Using the `Coordinate Vertices` option will run an additional operation to adjust the number of vertices in the rooms that were pulled. This results in better matching of segments between the rooms like so:

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Grid Increment

A number larger than 0 to set the distance between grid increments. Keep in mind that this value can be different from the grid size in the preview.

</details>

Snap the selected rooms to a cartesian grid defined by a `Grid Increment` distance, which sets the resolution of the grid. This command is particularly useful for IES VE users who often need the model to be snapped to a grid.

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Parent Edge Offset

A number to set the minimum distance from the parent edge after rebuilding the apertures.

#### Rectangle

A boolean to note if the non-rectangular aperture should be further simplified into rectangular shapes.

</details>

Rebuild the apertures of the rooms by merging the colliding apertures and trimming those that extend past the parent Face. The `Rectangle` option can be used to further simplify non-rectangular apertures into rectangular shapes.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/simplify-windows.svg) Simplify windows

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Delete Interior

A boolean to note if the interior windows should be removed from the rooms.

#### Ignore Skylights

A boolean to note if the skylights should be ignored during the process of simplifying the windows.

#### Ignore Windows

A boolean to note if the windows should be ignored during the process of simplifying the windows.

#### Merge Distance

The maximum distance between the window and skylight polygons to merge the windows and skylights.

</details>

Use this command to simplify windows and skylights. This command merges the windows on each face into a single window located in the center of the face.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/solve-adjacency.svg) Solve adjacency

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Intersect

A boolean to note if the room walls should be intersected based on the neighbor rooms before solving the adjacency between them. Unless your input model has the correct intersections this option should be left as selected.

#### Ceiling Adjacencies

A boolean to note if the adjacency between the stories should also be calculated.



</details>

Solve adjacency between selected rooms by assigning interior boundary conditions where rooms touch one another. You can optionally turn off the `Ceiling Adjacency` if you are primarily interested in simulating each Story as a distinct unit with adiabatic floors and ceilings. This command will only be visible when more than one room is selected.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/reset-adjacency.svg) Reset adjacency

Reset all of the wall boundary conditions to outdoors. Use this command to create a clean starting point for running "solve adjacency" or "alignment" commands.

### ![](../.gitbook/assets/merge-rooms.svg) Merge rooms

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Simplify Windows

A boolean to note if the windows should be simplified when merging rooms.

#### Join Faces

A boolean to note if the coplanar walls should be joined together when merging rooms.

#### Merge Distance

The maximum distance between the rooms in which the rooms should be merged.

</details>

Merge several rooms into a single room. Setting a `Merge Distance` that is larger than 0 will allow you to merge rooms that have gaps in between them (crossing gaps up to the specified distance). This option is particularly useful for IDA ICE users who must work with rooms that are exported at the interior wall finish.

### Create boundary

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Mode

The calculation mode for creating boundaries. The options are `Include Holes`, `Exclude Holes` , and `Holes Only`.

#### Merge Distance

The maximum distance between the vertices that should be merged together when creating the boundaries.

</details>

Create polyline boundaries around a selection of rooms. The command can return polylines for either the exterior border around the rooms or just the holes (or both). You can use the generated borders for aligning the existing rooms or creating new rooms. See line commands for the full list of the available commands.

### Split core and perimeter

<details>

<summary>Options</summary>

#### Air Boundary

A boolean to note if the new separation walls between the core and perimeter rooms should be set to `Air Boundary`.

#### Offset Distance

The distance that the perimeter of the rooms should be offset.

</details>

Create core and perimeter rooms for a selected room. This is particularly useful for creating models according to typical zoning practices, where each fa√ßade orientation is a separate zone. The perimeter rooms will have a depth equal to the specified `Perimeter Offset` and the `Air Boundary` option lets you optionally set the boundaries between the core and perimeter rooms to an air boundary if the room being split represents an open space. It is recommended to clean up small edges and join coplanar faces before running this command.
